# Motivation
Finding the right fire equipment fast in a fire engine is always a topic. And because of the  special situation 2020/2021 (I don't write it directly, to avoid to get a bad karma) an old idea came back in my mind.

Why not showing the fire engine with pictures in a web interface and asking where to find a specific equipment item? The little Fire Equipment Game Engine was born. ;-)
